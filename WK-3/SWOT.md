<!-- ---------------Strengths----------------- -->

<!--Creative-->

Unique way of viewing problems that arise. To change the world you have to view the world differently. This is a strength for problem solving and idea generation.

<!--Strong desire to learn-->

2 College degrees currently. My next step will be to pursue a PHd in Mathmatics. This shows a continued pursuit to improve.

<!--Driven-->

Veteran, inventor, and competitor. I understand that hitting stumbling blocks along the way is part of the journey. These blocks provide opportunities to grow not only personally but proffessionally.

<!-- --------------Opportunites--------------- -->

<!-- Self-starter -->

A desire to be self-employed. With these as a goal, everything is an opportunity to improve not only social skills, but technically as well. A single goal of self-employment. The self-starter menatality gives me the advantage of "When one door closes, another is going to open" The hard part is making the leap.

<!-- Positive Attitude -->

This is an opportunity because mental, physical, and emotional health lead to a more complete life. This in turn leads to a person who can work as an employee or a leader.

<!-- Trends -->

We live in a different world now. There are unique trends to all fields right now, so the goal is to identify what your field is and what the current trends are. I am a Hot Rodder and the current trend is to make all cars electric, self-driving, and automated. The automotive industry is in the news for software developers almost daily. This has impacted even the magazines around cars- they are going full digital on the internet. This has led to an increase in developers needed even in media outlets.

<!-- ----------------- Weaknesses ---------------- -->

<!-- Lack of skill -->

I realize after taking the codeworks full stack developer course, that I will not be able to go out and get a job afterward. There are developers who went through the course, had more talent and natural skill, that are sitting in coffee shops unemployeed. This tells me the industry does not favor people with only bootcamps and youtube code-alongs as developers. I will have to go back to my original carrer field or get my own project off the ground.

<!-- Variety of skills -->

With the industry full of code languages- What code would be the correct one to learn and show skill in- after graduation? Without a goal any road will get you to where you are going. That being said- with a goal of app development and self- employment it should narrow down the choices to maximum-bang-for-the-buck. What app could I devleop and deploy to light the rocket?

<!--  Akwardness  -->

An understated weakness in most people now adays. What is it that makes a charasmatic, unique, and driven leader? We all look at Steve Jobs or Elon Musk and only see the face in the media, but when you dig a little deeper, you find a PERSON. A person who has their own unique flaws that they have turned into a strength to move away from employed by others, to EMPLOYING others.

<!-- -------------------Threats -------------------- -->

<!--  Skill  -->

My competition is out there getting better. They know they need to get their own projects off the ground. This is always a threat to all industries and workers. What if A.I. makes developers obslolete? There are so many threats from the unkown that I feel it is the most understated threat of all- that being said - it also the greatest source of insperation. The unkown is just that- the opportunity to provide something that has never been seen in the world.

<!--  Different mind set  -->

This is a threat as all change to "doing things the way we always have" will always be viewed as a threat, until it becomes a "set standard." When the cell phone arrived on the scene, people began to believe the rado waves would harm them. Its a constant struggle to be against the crowd enough to get new ideas out, but also be able to market them. Everybody has bills even creators.

<!--   The world stage -->

This world is hitting us every week with something new and scary. It is constantly changing what the norms and standards are. With the advent of 24h news people are constantly being flooded with whats new or whats scary. As Elon Musk has proven time and time again, a person viewed as an innovator will be either loved and accepted or accepted and respected. I phrase it that way because Musk has done things that should have been viewed as small (ex. smoking weed with Joe Rogan, then being fined $40M by the SEC (subnote- why the SEC??). ). Its the Joe Rogan podcast and it should have been viewed as not a big deal, but the society views his opinions and actions with respect.
